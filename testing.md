## Browsers
The site was tested across multiple browsers - Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera to ensure each page displayed correctly.
Browser compatibility was also tested using the Lambdatest App.

## Responsiveness
The site's reponsiveness was continuously monitored during the development stage using Chromes *Dev Tools*.
Media queries have been added to ensure all elements resize with any issues at the various Bootstrap breakpoints.
Further testing was done using [Responsive Test Tool](http://responsivetesttool.com/) which allowed for testing on additional devices - no errors were recorded.

## Manual Testing

Manual testing was completed at various stages throughout development. This ensured all elements responded correctly to each interaction as intended and functions ouput the correct result.
